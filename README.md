# GRAPH-HEAL: Graph-Based Hierarchical Error Analysis and Learning

This project implements a graph-based system for monitoring, detecting faults, and self-healing in a microservice environment.

## Components

- **Microservices**: A set of simple Flask services that communicate with each other
- **Graph Model**: Representation of the system as a graph of interconnected services
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics collection from services
- **Fault Detection**: Identifying anomalies in the system
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically recovering from failures

## Getting Started

1. Install Docker and Python 3.9+
2. Set up the environment:
